# Sort-String-descending
Imagine a CSV file called input.csv, which contains a single line of comma-separated strings. This single line is terminated with a new line character. Using an appropriate language, write a program that reads input.csv, sorts its strings into descending alphabetical order, and writes the sorted strings in comma-separated format to a new file called output.csv. Here are sample contents of these two files (but your program should handle other content as well): • input file: Copenhagen,Stockholm,Oslo • output file: Stockholm,Oslo,Copenhagen
